# Is this gem ready for Rails 4?

Rails 4 has been released, but many gems are not yet compatible with Rails 4.

[Ready4Rails4.net](http://ready4rails4.net) lists many gems and shows whether
they are ready for Rails 4 or not. You can also paste your Gemfile to get a
one-click report of the status of your Gemfile gems.

## Thanks to

* all the people who reports new gem status and add new gems to the site
* [amarraja](https://github.com/amarraja) for allowing the users to paste their
Gemfiles
