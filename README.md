Is this gem ready for Rails 4?
==============================

Rails 4 has been released, but many gems are not yet compatible with Rails 4.

[Ready4Rails4.net][website] lists many gems and shows whether they are ready
for Rails 4 or not. You can also paste your Gemfile to get a one-click report
of the status of your Gemfile gems.

Thanks to
---------

* all the people who reports new gem status and add new gems to the site.
* [Amar Raja][amarraja] for allowing the users to paste their Gemfiles.
